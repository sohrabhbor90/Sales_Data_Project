# Sales_Data_Project
Project in Data Analytics using fictional sales data with Excel, SQL and Python. (Version for Potential Recruiters). 

Used a fictional sales data set from Google. Cleaned and structured this through Excel, using specific tangible functions such as UPPER() to format name casing in the first column. Column 1 - CustomerID. Identified missing cells in the quantity column - and figured out the number of orders by dividing total amount from unit price. Seperated the address in to different columns, via city, state and zip code. Allso made a quantifiable column that showed sales trend by month. Also removed any duplicate rows, and ordered the customer ID in numerical order. 

Sheet 3 in Excel shows column chart by product category with Electronics being the largest part of revenue, calculated as a percentage of 85%. Sheet 8 shows sales trend month by month with amount of customer orders and the sum of that amount for the  month, which is visualised through a line graph. 

Utilised SQL for data extraction - using complex queries such as GROUPBY and select statements.

The python code creates the file path for the sales database to be created, and then SQL tools for data extraction through SQL. The python code uses the sales_data_clean.csv file. Firstly creting a file path for the data to be manipulated and used. And then various print statements to show sales by category, total sales and number of customer through the unique formula.
